# Manifesto Cardano Brasil

📌 *Manifesto Cardano Brasil* is a community-led initiative funded by the Cardano Treasury through Project Catalyst. Its core mission is to identify, document, and express the political, social, and governance values of the Brazilian and Portuguese speaking Cardano communities through critical dialogue, community sensing, and reflection.

## 📘 What is a Manifesto?

A manifesto is a public declaration of intentions, motives, or views of an individual or group — often political, social, or artistic in nature. It may either challenge prevailing norms or promote a new framework for change. The term originates from the Italian *manifesto*, which itself derives from the Latin *manifestum*, meaning “clear” or “visible.”

## 💡 Why a Manifesto?

This project aimed to formalize a written manifesto with input from the Brazilian and Portuguese speaking Cardano communities, offering guidance for dReps. These guidelines are intended to help dReps represent their local communities more legitimately when voting on governance updates and treasury allocation.

The initiative was inspired by:
- The [Cypherpunk Manifesto](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html), which advocates for privacy through cryptography  
- The [Ergo Manifesto](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-10-20-ergo-manifesto/), rooted in cooperation, privacy, and financial fairness

## 🧭 Project Proposal and Methodology

**Title:** *DReps LATAM – Brasil – Exploration & Community Sensing*  
**Funding Source:** Project Catalyst  
**Stage:** Exploratory Phase (Phase 1)

For Cardano governance to be truly decentralized and inclusive, it must represent diverse social and regional communities. This project focuses on understanding the values, concerns, and expectations of the Brazilian and Portuguese speaking communities so they may be meaningfully represented by their dReps and Catalyst dReps.

The initiative is structured in two phases:
- **Phase 1 (approved and completed) :** Community sensing through public debates, surveys, and analysis
- **Phase 2 (future):** Representation based on Phase 1 insights
